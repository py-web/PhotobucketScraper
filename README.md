A purpose-built tool to make a task for a friend quicker and easier. It takes an RSS feed for a photobucket album, downloads every image in it in order, then compiles them into a PDF.
It requires Python (tested on 2.7, probably works on 2.6 and earlier too), and [ReportLab Toolkit](http://www.reportlab.com/software/opensource/rl-toolkit/download/) to generate PDFs.
